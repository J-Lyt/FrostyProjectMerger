# Frosty Project Merger
A plugin for the Frosty Toolsuite which merges multiple project files into one. To use, click on the "File" tab and select "Import from Project..." and select the project you would like imported.

**WARNING:** Be careful when allowing the plugin to overwrite files that have already been modified in a project, as if you tell it to it will overwrite them regardless of the damage it could cause.
